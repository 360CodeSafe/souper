candidate improvements:
- attempt to synthesize arbitrary width integer constants
- attempt to synthesize undef
- put instructions in candidates

Make it possible to run Souper as a Clang pass. Hack Clang to run it
after each invocation of InstCombine. This serves two purposes: first,
making it trivial to run Souper on large codes; second, establishing
an upper bound on the speedup that can be gained by integrating
Souper's findings into LLVM passes.

extraction improvements

caching:
- local, using std::unordered_map or something
- remote, using Redis or something
- key: the extracted expression
- value: 
  - best known solution
  - no solution
  - solver timeout
  - solver hasn't been run on this one yet
  - flagged for manual inspection
